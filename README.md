# ⛳ Monday Club - Golf Community/Tournament App

Monday Club App is a casual golf score tracking tool built for private groups to log rounds, compare scores, and automatically update leaderboards with minimal effort.

## 📝 Overview
This project began as a collaboration with my friend Charlie Lin to help his dad track weekly scores for his local golf club community. We wanted to build a simple, reliable solution for older golfers to log scores and view leaderboards without complex tech. Tossing ideas back and forth and seeing it come to life was one of the most rewarding parts of the project.

## 🚀 Features
- Log individual and group scores with clean round history views  
- Automatically updates leaderboards using a daily scheduled cron job  
- Responsive UI optimized for mobile use on the golf course  
- Simple, clean layout for easy score tracking at a glance  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
